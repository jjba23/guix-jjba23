* Supreme Sexp System - SSS

A Lisp machine adventure, where GNU and Lisp are celebrated, GNU is love, GNU is life. 

Find the divine sayings, and the destined configurations, all my Guix, Scheme, Common Lisp and Emacs Lisp configurations here for learning you a fully Lisp machine with GNU/Linux for a great good.

* Words of Advice

Learning Lisps is really going down a rabbit hole, but trust me, you will come out with a better understanding of programming as a whole out the other end.

This configuration is heavily biased towards containing a ~joe~ user who also acts as administrator for most of the time.

Your mileage may vary (YMMV).

Feel free to fork this, under the terms of the GNU GPL v3 or newer.

As your user ~joe~ run commands from the Makefile, like ~make fr~ or make ~sr~.

The system and home folders of users are managed independently of each other, in quite a loosely coupled manner.

It's possible you need to some manual installations, and temporary workarounds, in order to install ~sss~ on a brand-new Guix installation. For example including ~nonguix~ in your channels (=~/.config/guix/channels.scm=). You might also need to install tools like Git and GNU make temporarily.

#+begin_src  scheme
  (cons* (channel
        (name 'nonguix)
        (url "https://gitlab.com/nonguix/nonguix")
        (introduction
         (make-channel-introduction
          "897c1a470da759236cc11798f4e0a5f7d4d59fbc"

           "2A39 3FFF 68F4 EF7A 3D29 12AF 6F51 20A0 22FB B2D5"))))

It is *REQUIRED* to include a ~per-host.scm~ in the root of this project, which is excluded from Git, and will determine certain settings for your own machine.

#+begin_src  scheme
  (define sss-filesystems
    (list (file-system
           (device "/dev/nvme0n1p3")
           (mount-point "/")
           (type "ext4"))
          (file-system
           (device "/dev/nvme0n1p1")
           (mount-point "/boot/efi")
           (type "vfat"))))
#+end_src
